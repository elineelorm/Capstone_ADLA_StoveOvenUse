# Purpose of this class: This class tests the addRegularContacts method in the Database Server.
# The method requires a username and 3 contacts to add to the username's account as parameters.
# It first checks to see if the 3 contacts are valid to add. Then it updates the loginDB database
# to add the 3 contacts to the username's information in the database.
# It combines the validity of all three contacts into a string that is to be returned.
